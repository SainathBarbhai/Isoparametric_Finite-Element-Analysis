# Isoparametric_Finite-Element-Analysis


Hi  all,

I have been working on this code for the past week and a half. It's a fully working code, but I would appreciate it if people from numerical methods and computer science backgrounds could have a look and suggest any improvements to make the code more manageable and smaller.

Thanks!!

Please have a look at the FEA Github.pdf file for more information.
